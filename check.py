"""The gate. Run it before committing; the pre-commit hook runs it for you.

    python check.py
    python check.py --word-table <path to claude-dirty-words.py>

**This repository had NO gate at all until 2026-08-19**, and it was found the way
these things always are: a `Stop` hook caught Claude writing the British spelling of
"license" in a sentence to Terry, and the sweep that followed found the same word
already committed in `board_state.py`. **941 lines of prose-heavy Python went in on one day
with nothing reading any of it.**

| Where | What watches it |
|---|---|
| What Claude SAYS | `~/.claude/hooks/claude-dirty-words-stop.py`, every turn |
| `FlickrGroupAddr/backend-api` | `scripts/claude-dirty-words.py`, under `npm run check` |
| **This repository, until now** | **nothing** |

**The `Stop` hook watches speech, not files** -- its own docstring says so. So it could
catch the word in a sentence and could never have caught the identical word sitting in
`board_state.py`.

## The word table is BORROWED, not copied

**`hits_in` is imported from FlickrGroupAddr's `scripts/claude-dirty-words.py`**, which
is the canonical table. **A second copy would drift, and the table is the whole tool.**

**That repository is PUBLIC, which is what makes this work in CI.** `claude-config` --
where the `~/.claude` wrapper lives -- is PRIVATE, so reaching it from a public
repository's workflow would need a token stored as a secret. **A spell-checker is not
worth a credential in a public repository**, and the public table makes the question
moot.

## A MISSING TABLE FAILS LOUDLY. IT IS NEVER SKIPPED

**This is the design constraint, not a detail.** A gate that quietly does not run is
worse than no gate, because it reads as a pass. An absent table prints a banner and
**exits non-zero**, exactly as a real finding would.

## The detector is PROVEN TO BITE on every run

**A poisoned control line goes through it first.** A checker pointed at the wrong thing
and a checker that finds nothing are indistinguishable from outside, so a clean result
is only believable after something known-bad has come back dirty.
